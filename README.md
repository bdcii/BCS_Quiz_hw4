## Objective
    My goal is to create a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz.




 ## Rules 

 1. Upon clicking the Start button, the countdown timer will begin and the user will be presented with the first question.
 2. When the correct answer is selected, the user will get points and the next question will be presented.  
        -when a wrong answer is selected, time will be taken off the countdown timer as a penalty.

 3. When all questions have been answered, the user will be presented with their score.  They will have the option to submit their score to the 
    High Score list, and restart the quiz if desired.
